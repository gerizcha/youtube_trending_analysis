Have been working on this for 2 weeks, with the highest motivation is learning and investing.
This is also due to my project as a assignment project of bootcamp Data Science and Machine Learning.

The story was:
ABCXYZ company is one of the securities companies in the United States, which is currently focusing on increasing Brand Awareness.
The Marketing Director assigns projects to achieve this goal. One of his tasks is to make the video on the company's official channel penetrate trending on YouTube no later than 3 months from the time the video is uploaded. Therefore, one of the Data Scientists in the company is assigned to do an analysis of what needs to be done to optimize the opportunity for videos on the company's official YouTube channel to become Trending. The results of this analysis will be presented to the Marketing Director and also to the Creative Team for implementation.

This analysis will provide you many references of codes/syntaxes, the systematic and coherent explanation, and insights also actionable recommendations.
The dataset was very old though, but you can cherry picking based on your needs.
I HOPE IT WOULD HELP!
